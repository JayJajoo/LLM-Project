The initial semesters focus on core courses to establish a strong theoretical and analytical base. Electives are introduced in the third semester to deepen quantitative and data skills relevant to portfolio management, aligning with the student's goal of becoming an expert. The final semester emphasizes practical portfolio management courses, including the core FINA6219 and FINA6240, which synthesize prior knowledge into applied skills. Workload is balanced across semesters, with each semester containing approximately 8 credits, adhering to scheduling constraints. Prerequisites are respected by sequencing courses accordingly, and no courses are skipped or duplicated. The selected electives complement the core curriculum, providing advanced quantitative, data, and management skills necessary for expertise in portfolio management.",
